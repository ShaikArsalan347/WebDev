            <p>
                Our furniture is crafted from a variety of high-quality materials, including solid wood, engineered wood, metal, glass, and premium upholstery fabrics. Each material is selected for its durability, aesthetic appeal, and ability to enhance the overall design of the piece.

                <p>
                    Proper care depends on the material of your furniture. For wood pieces, we recommend using a soft, damp cloth for cleaning and avoiding harsh chemicals. Upholstered items should be vacuumed regularly and spot-cleaned as needed. We also offer care guides specific to each material, which can be found on the product page.

                        Yes, many of our furniture pieces can be customized to suit your preferences. This may include selecting different fabrics, finishes, or dimensions. Customization options are detailed on each product page, or you can contact our customer service team for more information.
